# BetterRTM
Add some useful functions for RTM for modelpack creators.

This project uses [mod-patching](https://github.com/fixrtm/mod-patching) gradle plugin by anatawa12.

Some further & stable functions will be added to [fixRTM](https://github.com/fixrtm/fixRTM).



## Issue

Because mod-patching is strange. It's only for fixRTM. The build in this project can't take effects to RTM. All patch files are correct. It will (may) be solved in the future.



Notice that the main function of this mod (add new & flexible way to render RTM rails) will become the dependency of CacPixel's Realistic Metro Pack. (Rigid catenary, or overhead conduct rails need this. Useless rail pieces by the track & rail connectors also need this)

Changing the sound rendering is possible in the future.
